# Hardware and Software Prerequisites

Before you begin using the BioNeMo framework, please ensure the following prerequisites are met.

## Hardware

The BioNeMo Framework is compatible with environments that have access to NVIDIA GPUs. Bfloat16 precision requires an Ampere generation GPU or higher. Tested GPUs include: H100, A100, and RTX A6000. There is mixed support for GPUs without bfloat16 support, such as V100, T4, Quadro RTX 8000, and GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. GPUs with known issues include: Tesla K80.

## Software

The BioNeMo Framework is supported on x86 Linux systems. Please use the projectâ€™s Docker images to develop and execute the code.

Please ensure that the following are installed in your desired execution environment:
* Appropriate GPU drivers
* Docker (with GPU support, Docker Engine 19.03 or above)
* [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) to allow Docker to access the GPUs
